Audi’s all-new A8 limo is set to introduce a new technology aimed at reducing the risk to passing cyclists. The Exit Warning system 
scans the area behind a parked vehicle and will lock the doors until the coast is clear to protect passers by.

While cyclist safety is the primary aim of the system, Exit Warning will also keep the doors closed for passing cars and trucks reducing 
not only the risk of injury, but also ensuring the A8 (and any passing vehicles) won't require an expensive trip to a body repair shop.

The new system is an extension of technology already found in Audi vehicles including the A4 range and Q7 SUV which use warning lights to
 alert occupant to the presence of an oncoming bicycle or other traffic. The A8 steps up its level of protection by physically blocking an incident from occurring.

The A8 has a number of ultrasonic radar sensors on its front and rear bumpers that give it a medium range view of the surrounding world and
 can alert the driver when it is safe to change lanes, and will be expanded over time to include advanced semi-autonomous functions.

As an extension of that role the rear sensors can also check for traffic, including bicycles, approaching from the rear for up to three minutes
 after the engine has been turned off.

As with the A4 and Q7, the driver (or anyone else seated next to a door) will see red lights flashing on the door trim if they grab the door
 handle when a bicycle is approaching from behind.
