<center>The Teen Driver technology, which is standard equipment on most of the GMC lineup, is a feature that helps guide teens to develop safe driving habits.
 Teen Driver allows GMC owners to program the equipped vehicle key fob to activate the system. The system is designed to encourage good driving habits while behind
 the wheel, along with providing feedback on their driving performance through an industry-first report card.

“Teen Driver reinforces safe driving habits, like seat belt use and watching your speed,” Beebe explains.
 “Teen Driver also makes sure that active safety features if equipped on the vehicle are always turned on so that they can help alert a teen to avoid a 
crash or lessen its severity.”

Once activated, a vehicle operated with a Teen Driver key fob can limit certain vehicle features and prevent certain safety systems from being switched
 off. Additionally, an in-vehicle report card can provide details into distance driven, maximum speed, number of over speed warnings, and other driving events, 
providing parents with useful information for coaching their new driver.
